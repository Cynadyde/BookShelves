# BookshelfDisplay

BookshelfDisplay is a Spigot MC Plugin that lets the player use bookshelves to display galleries of books.
Visit this plugin's [SpigotMC Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bookshelfdisplay.67225/) for more information.

To install, simply place the jar file in your server's `plugins` folder. You will need a single dependency, 
[ProtocolLib 4.5](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/). (This plugin will not work with ProtocolLib 
version 4.4!) Place this jar in your `plugins` folder, also.
